```

### Step 5: Run ZERO-YOLO
Choose one of these options based on your computer:

#### Option A: If you have a graphics card (NVIDIA)
```bash
docker compose --profile gpu up --build
```
Then open: http://localhost:8501 in your web browser

#### Option B: If you don't have a graphics card
```bash
docker compose --profile cpu up --build
```
Then open: http://localhost:8501 in your web browser

## How to Use ZERO-YOLO üéØ

### Step 1: Prepare Your Images
1. Create a folder named `data` in the ZERO-YOLO folder
2. Create two folders inside `data`:
   a. _'image'_: contains all images.
   b. _'mask'_: contains all segmentation masks.
4. Put your images in the `input` folder
   - Supported formats:  TIFF, PNG, JPG

### Step 2: Use the Web Interface
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to:
   - http://localhost:8501 (For web app)


## Common Problems and Solutions üîß

### Problem: "Docker not found"
Solution: Make sure Docker is installed and running. Try restarting your computer. 

### Prroblem: 

### Problem: "Port already in use"
Solution: 
1. Close any other applications that might be using the ports
2. Or try these commands:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose --profile cpu up --build  # for CPU version
# OR
docker compose --profile gpu up --build  # for GPU version
```

## Play with sample dataset. 
With this repo you have sample images in `data.zip` unzip it and start playing with it. For labels we have provided an excel file `label_names.xlsx`.
